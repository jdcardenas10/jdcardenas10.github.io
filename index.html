		<h2>What i've worked on</h2>
		<p>I’ve worked in some projects during my time in the university. I’ve worked in a project for simulating a transactional System, With representations of the real world. The project is ‘PuertoAndes’, for the database subject.</p> 

		<p>I’ve worked in a project for SW team development subject, where we had to set a website for booking and offering vacation rooms.</p> 

		<p>In software architecture i worked in a project where we implemented an IOT solution for protecting houses with electronic remote controlled locks.</p>

		<p>And’ve also worked in projects or experiments where We had to compares the throughput of many different software configurations.</p>

		<p>In informatics, i like the communications infrastructure for internet, and the way they are optimyzed and secured. I also like finding the best solution for a problem in informatics. It brings a sense of satisfaction.</p>

		<p>I am also interested in solving problems that somehow come useful for the next person facing a similar problem to solve.</p>
